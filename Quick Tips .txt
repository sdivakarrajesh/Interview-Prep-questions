For dates and time convert them to lower units to solve them easily and avoid clash

Remember Sieve of Eratosthenes

For checking prime or not just check upto sqrt of that number

Use Two friends algoithm

Use XOR to remove even Counted duplicates

ord for getting ascii in python

chr for getting char equivalent for integers in python

in C preincrement *ptr increases the value at the address by 1

in c postincrement *ptr steps the address x bytes (4 for int, 1 for char etc) 

c = 5,6,7 => gives 5 in c
b = (5,6,7) => gives 7 in c

Recursive calls are placed in stacks - when a function is called by itself before reaching the end, the remaining code gets executed in the reverse fashion
